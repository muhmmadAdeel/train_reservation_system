```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Initialize NPM Package**:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Create Environment File**:
   - Copy the contents from `text.env` to a new `.env` file
   - Fill in the required environment variables

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Database configuration can be found in:
   - `db.js` - Main database connection
   - `text-db.js` - Additional database utilities

2. Server configuration is in `server.js`

3. Routes are organized in the `routes/` folder

## Running the Application

Start the server with:
```bash
node server.js
```

## Important Notes

- Make sure all required environment variables are set in your `.env` file before starting the application
- The `node_modules` folder should not be committed to version control
- For production, ensure proper security measures are in place for database connections

## Questions for User

1. Could you confirm if you've already run `npm init` to create your `package.json` file?
2. Have you created your `.env` file based on the `text.env` template?
3. Are there any specific database credentials or API keys that need to be configured before running the application?
4. Would you like me to provide more details about any specific part of this project structure?
